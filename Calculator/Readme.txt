## ABOUT
Here I am writing a code for a calculator that allows user to perform basic arithmetic operations and also perform a touch of magic with special number inputs.

## FEATURES:
The calculator has the features to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also performs magic operations on special numbers. User can exit the calculator at any time.

## USAGE:
Upon launching the calculator, user will be prompted to select an operator or exit the program. User will enter the desired operator (+, -, x, /) to perform arithmetic operations on two numbers.
To witness magic, user will select the magic option and enter a number between 1 and 100. User will enter exit to terminate the calculator.
